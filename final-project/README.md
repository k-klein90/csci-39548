Bug: When a task is deleted from AllTasksView or from SingleTaskView, AllTasksView will break with the error "Rendered fewer hooks than expected." Refreshing the page shows the expected result of the deletion. The error does not occur when the logic for getting the name of the task's employee is removed. The problem may be caused by the useSelector hook.
